    WHERE WE COME FROM
</h3>

<p>
In 1958, two friends acquire some money from their mother to open a small eatery put in Wichita, Kansas. They named it ‘Organization Name’ , in light of the fact that their sign just had space for eight letters. How significant!

Before long, the eatery developed. Why? The food was great. The services felt like home. What’s more, the clients were dealt with like family. We’ve been conveying that equivalent food and administration from that point onward.

FOR THE LOVE OF PIZZA SINCE 1958

From the very first moment, the friends could look at their clients without flinching and guarantee them the best food around the local area — in light of the fact that they knew the ranchers who developed the fixings, and they realized those agriculturists thought about quality.

From that point forward, our agriculturists have developed directly close by us, and the fixings we use are as yet our most noteworthy need. Nobody cherishes food more than ‘Organization Name’ . That is the reason food is in our name — and dependably will be.
